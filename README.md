# MSSE661MongoAPI



After some work and following Dave Grey's tutorials on getting a server going, I finally have my server and API running. I have my code in JS working with Mongo. I built my server by deploying the express, dotenv, bcrypt, cookie-parser, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, uuid, cors, and date-fns packages on Node. I tested my API using Thunder Client on VS. I don't have a lot to compare Thunder Client to, but I thought it was pretty neat to be able to run my tests inside VS. This was a lot of work and the final project is nowhere near perfect, but I'm happy with the hours and work I put into building it!
